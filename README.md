# CT-Capstone

### This is my final project to graduate from coding temples.

The goal of this project was to create a digital bookshelf for organizing readings lists for the user. This project was shelved(pun definitely intended) after graduation
as I focus on learning more CS concepts and furthering my knowledge in other areas.

The app is still online and can be reached [here](https://coding-temple-capstone.herokuapp.com/). This is hosted on heroku using the ecodyno option, so allow some time to load.
